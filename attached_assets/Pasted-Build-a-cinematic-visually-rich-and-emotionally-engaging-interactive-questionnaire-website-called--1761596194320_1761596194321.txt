Build a cinematic, visually rich, and emotionally engaging interactive questionnaire website called “Combined College Student Stress Scale (CCSSS)”.

The site must feel alive — immersive animations, glowing gradients, and fluid transitions that make the user feel they’re part of an intelligent, calm, and futuristic self-assessment journey.

🎨 Visual Atmosphere

Overall mood: a mix of calm psychology and sleek sci-fi minimalism.

Use deep gradients with glow effects — think indigo fading into turquoise, or cosmic violet blending into coral orange.

Add depth and motion: parallax layers, floating particles, subtle lens-flare streaks on hover.

Fonts: “Poppins SemiBold” for headings, “Inter Regular” for text. Big, airy spacing.

Cards and buttons use glassmorphism — translucent backgrounds with blur and inner glow.

Make every interaction tactile: soft button pulses, hover shimmer, slide-up question reveals.

🧭 Flow & Interaction

1. Hero / Landing Section

Full-screen gradient motion background with slow waves or particle drift.

Central headline: “Combined College Student Stress Scale (CCSSS)”

Subtext fades in: “Discover your stress and resilience through a guided experience.”

A large glowing “Start Assessment” button that expands slightly on hover.

Clicking it smoothly scrolls (or fades) to the questionnaire.

2. Core Questionnaire (10 Questions)

Each question appears inside a floating glass card with animated entrance.

Below each question, five circular rating buttons (0-4) glow when hovered or selected.

Progress bar or ring fills with color as user advances.

Background shifts hue subtly every few questions to keep visual rhythm.

When user finishes core 10:

If total ≤ 13 → transition to Results Scene (gentle fade-out, reveal animated score).

If total > 13 → trigger “Unlock Optional Modules” animation (like cards flipping open).

3. Conditional Modules (Adaptive Flow)

The site intelligently chooses which modules to display based on responses:

Heavy workload ≥ 2 and Pressure to maintain grades ≥ 2 → Academic Module

Poor sleep ≥ 2 → Health & Lifestyle Module

Financial difficulties ≥ 2 → Financial & Practical Module

Every user → Social / Relationships Module

Each module starts with a short animated title (“Module B — Social Connections”) then five questions appear one by one with motion blur fade-ins.

Use different background color themes per module (Academic = violet/blue; Social = rose/pink; Financial = amber/gold; Health = green/teal).

Display a floating label like “Module 2 of 4” at the top.

4. Result Generation

After modules end, calculate: Total = Core + Modules

Animate transition into a Result Dashboard Scene:

A circular gauge that fills from 0 → score with easing animation.

Gauge color morphs from green → yellow → red based on stress level.

Beside it, small animated bars for Academic / Social / Financial / Health stress.

Dynamic message (typewriter animation):

“Your stress level is Moderate. Academic and lifestyle pressures are most prominent.”

Subtle confetti or particle burst when results appear.

Buttons: glowing “Download PDF Report” and “Retake Assessment.”

5. Ending Scene

Soft ambient background animation continues.

Footer fades in:

“Developed by Group 10 — Workplace Stress Resilience Prediction Project, Techno Main Salt Lake.”

🧠 Logic & Data Rules (Preserve Functionality)

Core 10 questions → 0–4 ratings → if score > 13 → show optional modules.

Optional modules displayed conditionally as above.

Total Score = Core (0–40) + Selected Modules (0–80).

Classification thresholds: 0–33 % = Low, 34–66 % = Moderate, 67–100 % = High.

Each transition animated; nothing jumps abruptly.

Store answers in local state (no backend needed).

Optional JSON/CSV export on completion.

🪄 Experience Goals

Never static — every movement feels intentional.

No white page feel — keep depth, contrast, light bloom.

Emotionally balanced — calm sound or silent by default but visually expressive.

Should feel like an interactive wellness app, not a Google Form.

🚀 Deliverable

A one-page immersive website that flows like this:
Hero → Core Questions → Adaptive Modules → Animated Results → Credits.

The result must be visually bold, smooth, and expressive — closer to a digital art experience than a static survey, while keeping all scientific logic intact.
